## 🔹 Unit Testing  
- Conducted by the **Developer (You)** before committing code  
- Covers individual functions and modules  
- Uses frameworks like JUnit, PyTest, Mocha, Jest, etc.  

## 🔹 Code Testing by the Testing Team  
- Comprehensive test cases with various inputs  
- Edge cases to validate system robustness  
- Regression testing to check new changes do not break existing functionality  

## 🔹 Integration Testing  
- Validating how your code interacts with other team members' code  
- Ensuring data consistency across modules  
- Mocking external dependencies where necessary  

## 🐞 Code Defects / Bugs  
- Bugs tracked using **JIRA**, Trello, or other bug tracking tools  
- Severity classification: Critical, High, Medium, Low  
- Resolution lifecycle: Report → Assign → Fix → Verify → Close
